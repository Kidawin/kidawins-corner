To Do

fix navbar:
https://www.reddit.com/r/neocities/s/LSyxjqC5C8

idea: im wanting to try and do some things weekly, like listen to a new album each week, play a game in my steam library, watch a new movie, maybe even like learn about a new topic? maybe even cooked something new
anyways, on the site i could do a blog that i update on sundays or saturdays or whenever, and i could talk about those weekly things but also what ive read, or watched, just a weekly thing to talk about what new or even old things ive done this week
