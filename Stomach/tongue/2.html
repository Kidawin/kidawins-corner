    <p class="small-text">I saw this recommended in a discord and enjoyed it a lot, I'll definitely keep listening so I remember it more. Very chill and I sort of faded into it the first time I listened earlier this week.</p>

    <p class="small-text">Incredible. I was sitting forward in my chair eyes glued to the screen the whole time, rooting so hard for Baby and Deborah to get away, heart beating even harder. I loved the contant intensity, but my favorite part was the musical aspect, I loved that it was kind of like a celebration of music too. I've been getting into music a lot more this year (hence the album part of the challenge) and I think it made me like this movie a lot more.</p>

<p class="small-text">I hadn't watched a movie all this week but I wanted to at least get the first two weeks in a row haha, so I sat down to find something less than 2 hours long. I saw this and had been wanting to watch it for a while, but still was kind of treating this like needing to knock it out. But, like clockwork, I was so captivated and it reminded me of a big reason why I wanted to do this challenge in the first place: so I can make myself stop pretty much forgetting about movies and make a habit of watching them more often. I've been trying to un-brainrot for a while and sometimes it's just too much to commit to watching a movie and paying close attention like I want to, and I need to change it so I'm more willing to do that.</p>

<p class="small-text">Another I'll need to write up a recipe for later, but I have made this before but a bit different. I used ground turkey this time and a lot of it, and I just throw in the rest of the ingredients and however much spices until it's good.</p>

<p class="small-text">I might have to just throw a category on here for the weekly The Ember Knight chapter, which was PHENOMENAL this week (216). We're inching ever closer along in the Hippo x Elephant fight, and Qilin will maybe make a move now... or at least he was trying to, until... RELEASE THE HEN! (Also RIP Cat... your big moment some chapters back really solidified this series as an all time favorite of mine)</p>
<p class="small-text">Been loving Phasmophobia lately, a friend has been carrying me but I'm finally getting the hang of the game in general. For a long while it was just incomprehensible to me.</p>
<p class="small-text">Was rewatching Burn Notice and just had to mention it, love that show.</p>
