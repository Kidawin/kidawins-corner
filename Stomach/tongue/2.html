<p>Hi, this is an example poste.</p>
<p class="sample-class">If I have .sample-class defined with styling information in a style sheet that index.html is linked, then it will also apply here without needing to put or link that CSS in this exact poste. Waouh!</p>
<p>Notice how I contain only the poste's content, and have no <html>, <meta> <head> or <body> tags, and no CSS.</p>
