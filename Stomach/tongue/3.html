    <p class="small-text">Went with my sister and we both really enjoyed it. It was a Very slow burn the first chunk of the movie which built up the tension really well, then it all exploded out. Amanda Seyfried puts her all into every moment and she felt like such a real person, she's really good at acting. The ending was also really satisfying, overall loved it. I think if I watch it a second time there will be a lot of little details to catch early on.</p>

    <p class="small-text">Listen... I followed the recipe on the chocolate chips package... but I might have put a tablespoon of baking soda instead of a teaspoon and had to fish some of it out... and then I put the eggs in too early... but I think the flour was bad anyways because an entirely separate batch turned out the same.</p>

<p class="small-text">Anyways we went to my grandma's last week and made a bunch of cookies. She said my batch was still good and it tasted like butterscotch or something, idk how I pulled that off from a chocolate chip recipe..</p>

</p>
<p class="small-text">Christmas this week! I will finally be rid of Razor products since I'm getting a new mouse.</p>
<p class="small-text">Incredible chapter for The Ember Knight (217). Qilin needs a favor, Waron is going to do what needs to be done, Hippo is my goat and figured out Elephant wasn't the malice she sensed, the Dragon's Descendants are moving, Najin backstory! This might be the most that has ever happened in a chapter.</p>
<p class="small-text">Kagurabachi... mark my words, this show is getting BIG if it gets a good adaptation. But there's so many series I love that get terribly adapted...</p>
