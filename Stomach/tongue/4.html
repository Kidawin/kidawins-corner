<p class="small-text">I skipped last week even though I shouldn't have, but it was the holidays and I was busy. Starting off the new year strong, I think I can lock in and get every week this year.</p>

    <p class="small-text">Loving the style and sound they have. This was another recommendation I got from the Mellowpunk discord as it was being recommended to someone else. Crazy good debut album, excited to relisten.</p>

    <p class="small-text">Creepy creepy creepy. I wasn't really expecting the extent to what the family was actually doing, they had me with the hypnotism but actually replacing part of the brain is wild. Satisfying ending, I was thinking the police that showed up might have been in on it but then the goat appeared instead. I really loved Nope from Jordan Peele so I need to go see what other movies he has, and I'm excited for more to come.</p>

<p><strong id="post-list-title">Food</strong>
    : Beef, corn, rice, pretty much it. | link
</p>
<p class="small-text">Again something I've pretty much made before, but it's a very freestyle-able meal. Just cool rice and ground beef, throw them together with a vegetable and beef broth. Something that we ate often as kids because you can make a lot easily and cheaply. It's hard enough cooking for myself I can't imagine my parents having to feed 6 picky kids.</p>
<p><strong id="post-list-title">Extras</strong>
    :
</p>
<p class="small-text">I finished Undead Unluck, and it was INCREDIBLE. This manga made me fall in love with each character one by one, even the ones I didn't care about when they were introduced earlier. Fuuko was a BOSS and I loved watching all her planning come to fruition, so satisfying. Also Rip my goat, threw a ring on BOTH sisters, insane. I need to strive for that level of game.</p>
<p class="small-text">Christmas Eve I caught up on a few of the Absolute series, mostly the Flash and Green Lantern, and they're all SO GOOD. That WW chapter was amazing, her and Bruce's interactions were so sweet, they were both just in awe at meeting someone else fighting the good fight like themselves.</p>
<p class="small-text">And of course, The Ember Knight. The last 2 chapters have been dropping BOMBS of backstory that have been setup for literally 200 chapters. Might have to drop another reread while waiting for more chapters... I still need to finish the Gilgamesh side stories tho.</p>
